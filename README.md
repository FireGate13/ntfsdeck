I would eventually like to make this into a guide to setup btrfs on your microSD card for the steam deck. For right now, I just have to get it working.. :)

The file in this is from the following file:

`/usr/lib/hwsupport/sdcard-mount.sh`

I haven't edited it yet but I am pretty sure I know what I am going to have to do.
